Hello there! My name is Mauricio Barca

Who am I?

What am I looking for?
I am looking for a new challenge! To learn and grow professionally in a new environment, meet new people, make new friendships, and prove to myself that I am capable of anything!

The best of me?
I am completely responsible in everything I do, motivated and passionate about doing what I love, always seeking that personal satisfaction of solving a problem and self-improvement.
